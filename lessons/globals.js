// These testing utilities that we built are pretty useful. We want
// to be able to use them throughout our application in every single
// one of our test files.

// Some testing frameworks provide their helpers as global variables.
// Letâ€™s implement this functionality to make it easier to use our testing
// framework and assertion library. We can do this by exposing our test and
// expect functions on the global object available throughout the application.
// Check out SecurityPolicyViolationEvent-globals.js for details
